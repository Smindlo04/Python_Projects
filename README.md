### Project List:
### 1. Project Name: Number_Operations
- Description: This program is code that takes user input, performs calculations and displays the results.
               The user inputs different types of values (strings, integers, decimals) and the appropriate
               operation is performed (concatenation or addition).
- Technologies used: IDLE and Atom.

### 2. Project Name: ASCII_Characters
- Description: This code converts a sequence of numbers into ASCII characters and prints the result.
               In essence, the code is a fun way of displaying a hidden message by converting its ASCII
               codes to characters.
- Technologies used: IDLE and Atom.

### 3. Project Name: Pythagorean_Theorem
- Description: This code checks if a triangle is a right-angled triangle based on the lengths of its sides
                 provided by the user. It uses the pythagorean theorem.
- Technologies used: IDLE and Atom.

### 4. Project Name: BMI_Calculator
- Description: This code is a user-friendly BMI(Body Mass Index) calculator with unit choice that allows the user to choose between using the metric
               system(kilograms and meters) or the imperial system(pounds and inches) to calculate their
               BMI and provide informative output.
